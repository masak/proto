[REAPP]   - Restart the web app before building DB; useful when you only made
            changes to the web app and don't want to wait ~1.5hr for the db
            build to complete before these changes will become live
[REBUILD] - Invalidate dist build caches and fetch full dist info for all dists
[NEWDB]   - Rebuild the database from scratch. Use this when you made changes
            to db structure
